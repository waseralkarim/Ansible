# Ansible Inventory

It is a file that defines the hosts of (remote systems) that you want to manage and the groups those hosts belong to.

### **Ansible inventory extensions:**

1. .ini format
2. .yaml format

### Types of Inventory:

- **Static**: Defined in a text file (ex: `inventory.ini`)
- **Dynamic**: Generated by a script or external source

### **Inventory.ini method:**

1. Inventory ini file can be anywhere on the system. We just have to pass the location on ansible execution
2. If you don’t want to pass the location just put it on /etc/ansible/hosts (recommended)

### Sample Inventory (.ini format):

```
[app]
appserver1@192.168.1.10

[db]
dbserver1@192.168.1.20
```
